# Gamestudio
klokhuis gamestudio demo voor kinderen met beperkingen

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  `cd gamestudio`

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  `npm start`<br>
    Starts the development server.

  `npm run build`<br>
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  `npm test`<br>
    Starts the test runner.

  `npm run eject`<br>
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
